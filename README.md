### MongoDB

MongoDB is the most popular NoSQL database. Unlike other relational databases, MongoDB does not have tables and columns. Instead, MongoDB has collections for tables and objects and properties for rows and columns. Collections store a list of objects and each object has a set of properties. Each object could have a different set of properties. Properties store values with a type. Not only you can use interger, string, and boolean types, but also, you can use a list or dictionary. 

The biggest advantage of using MongoDB over relational databases is that you can structure your data in a way that naturally fits the mental models. For example, when building a one-to-many relationship, instead of making separate collections, you can store the many as a list in the one.
